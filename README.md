PrePATH is a comprehensive preprocessing toolkit for whole slide images (WSI), built upon [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM) and [ASlide](https://github.com/MrPeterJin/ASlide).

## TODO 
- H0-mini
- OpenMidnight
- TITAN (Slide level)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Anaconda or Miniconda
- `openslide-tools` (system dependency)

### Setup Instructions

The following instructions demonstrate installation for the GPFM model. For other foundation models, please refer to their respective repositories for environment-specific requirements.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/birkhoffkiki/PrePATH.git
cd PrePATH
conda create --name gpfm python=3.10
conda activate gpfm
pip install -r requirements/gpfm.txt
cd models/ckpts/
wget https://github.com/birkhoffkiki/GPFM/releases/download/ckpt/GPFM.pth
```

**Notes:**
- ASlide should be installed as a Python package from [GitHub](https://github.com/MrPeterJin/ASlide) and is included in `requirements/gpfm.txt`.
- Environment configurations for other foundation models should be referenced from their respective repositories.

## Usage

### ⚡Using PrePATH to extract Patch-Level Features

#### Step 1: Coordinate Extraction
Extract coordinates of foreground patches from whole slide images:

```bash
# Configure variables in the script before execution
bash scripts/get_coors/example.sh
```

#### Step 2: Feature Extraction

Extract patch-level features using the selected foundation model:
```bash
# Refer to the script for detailed configuration options
bash scripts/extract_feature/one_gpu_example.sh
```
If you have multiple GPUs, you can use the `exe.sh` script for parallel processing:

```bash
bash scripts/extract_feature/exe.sh
```
#### Step 3: (Optional) Extract patches and pack them into HDF5 files
This is useful for pretraining or if you meet the `Corrupt JPEG data` error during feature extraction.  
This may happen for `kfb` or `sdpc` images due to limited support in multiprocessing.  
```bash
# Refer to the script for detailed configuration options
bash scripts/crop_image/example_packed2h5.sh
```
#### Step 4: (Optional) Extract features from HDF5 packed patches
If you have packed patches into HDF5 files in Step 3, you can extract features from them directly:
```bash
# Refer to the script for detailed configuration options
bash scripts/extract_feature/one_gpu_from_h5_example.sh
```

### ⚡Extract patches directly without feature extraction (e.g., for pretraining)
#### Step 1: Coordinate Extraction
Extract coordinates of foreground patches from whole slide images:
```bash
# Configure variables in the script before execution
bash scripts/get_coors/example.sh
```
#### Step 2: Patch Extraction
Extract patches based on the coordinates:  
We strongly recommend packing all patches using the HDF5 method for efficient storage and retrieval.
```bash
# Refer to the script for detailed configuration options
bash scripts/crop_image/example_packed2h5.sh
```
